**Sector Vestige** is a custom-content fork of the official [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) project.
We aim to create our own gameplay experience, with original mechanics, stations, and assets ‚Äî while staying aligned with the upstream SS14 codebase.

Sector Vestige is steadily building its own identity on top of the SS14 platform. While much of the game remains familiar to upstream, Sector Vestige actively develops new systems, balance changes, and unique content to support our long-term vision.

**Space Station 14** is a remake of the classic SS13, running on [RobustToolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) ‚Äî an open-source engine written in C# and purpose-built for multiplayer, tile-based simulation games.
